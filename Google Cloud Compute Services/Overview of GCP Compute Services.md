# Overview of Google Cloud Compute Services
These are the compute services available in the GCP cloud:
- Compute services are the most critical and highly used components in any cloud platform.
- Compute instances are also referred as workloads, as you can host any website or any custom application on top of a compute instances.
- Compute instance, simply means a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure Cloud and EC2 instance in AWS cloud.
- GCP offers a wide range of compute services. Here is a list
    - GCP Compute Engine
    - GCP App Engine
    - GCP Kubernetes Engine
    - GCP Cloud Run
    - GCP Cloud Run Functions
    - GCP Bare Metal
     
## 1. App Engine

## 2. Compute Engine

- Compute Engine is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering that provides scalable virtual machines (VMs) on Google's infrastructure.
- Compute Engine was launched in year 2012
- It supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.
- It offers various machine types to suit different workloads.
- As this being an IaaS offerings, users or consumers have full control over VM configurations, including CPU, memory and storage options.
- Primary use cases of Compute Engine: Web hosting, databases, big data processing, and enterprise applications.
### These are the Key Features of Compute Engine:
✅ Fully customizable VMs (CPU, RAM, disk, and GPU).
✅ Preemptible and Spot VMs (cost-saving for non-critical workloads).
✅ Live Migration (keeps VMs running during maintenance).
✅ Autoscaling & Load Balancing (optimizes performance).
✅ Confidential Computing (encrypts data in use).

## 3. Kubernetes Engine
- GKE is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling #containerized applications using Google's infrastructure. 
- It offers automated operations, integrated security, and enterprise-grade support.
