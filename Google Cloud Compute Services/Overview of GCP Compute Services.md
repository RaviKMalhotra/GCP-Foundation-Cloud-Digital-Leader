# Overview of Google Cloud Compute Services
These are the compute services available in the GCP cloud:
- Compute services are the most critical and highly used components in any cloud platform.
- Compute instances are also referred as workloads, as you can host any website or any custom application on top of a compute instances.
- Compute instance, simply means a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure Cloud and EC2 instance in AWS cloud.
- GCP offers a wide range of compute services. Here is a list
    - GCP Compute Engine
    - GCP App Engine
    - GCP Kubernetes Engine
    - GCP Cloud Run
    - GCP Cloud Run Functions
    - GCP Bare Metal
   -   
## 1. App Engine
Let's learn some of the basic characteristics of a Google App Engine:
-
- Google App Engine is one of the earliest cloud computing services from Google.
- launched in 2008 as a pioneering Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- It allows developers to build, deploy, and scale applications without worrying about managing the entire infrastructure.
- With automatic scaling, built-in load balancing, and support for multiple programming languages, App Engine enables businesses to focus solely on writing code while Google takes care of hosting and operations.
- Whether you are building a simple web app or a complex enterprise application, App Engine provides a seamless, fully managed environment to deploy applications effortlessly."
- Primary Use Cases: Web apps, APIs, and backend services.

### These are the Key Features of an App Engine:
‚úÖ Fully managed runtime environments (Python, Java, Go, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc.).
‚úÖ Automatic scaling & load balancing.
‚úÖ Integrated monitoring with Cloud Logging & Trace.
‚úÖ Traffic Splitting (A/B testing for different versions).
‚úÖ Built-in security & compliance.

## 2. Compute Engine
"When it comes to raw compute power and flexibility, Google Compute Engine stands as the backbone of Google Cloud‚Äôs infrastructure services. Launched in 2012, it provides highly customizable virtual machines (VMs) that can run various workloads, from web applications to high-performance computing. Compute Engine offers full control over VM configurations, allowing businesses to choose the right balance of CPU, memory, and disk storage to match their needs. With built-in security, live migration, and automatic scaling, it ensures that workloads remain performant, reliable, and cost-efficient."


- Compute Engine is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering that provides scalable virtual machines (VMs) on Google's infrastructure.
- Compute Engine was launched in year 2012
- It supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.
- you can create compute engine using the GCP console, and CLI. 
- It offers various machine types to suit different workloads.
- As this being an IaaS offerings, users or consumers have full control over VM configurations, including CPU, memory and storage options.
#### Primary use cases of Compute Engine: Web hosting, databases, big data processing, and enterprise applications.
 
### These are the Key Features of Compute Engine:
‚úÖ Fully customizable VMs (CPU, RAM, disk, and GPU).

‚úÖ Preemptible and Spot VMs (cost-saving for non-critical workloads).

‚úÖ Live Migration (keeps VMs running during maintenance).

‚úÖ Autoscaling & Load Balancing (optimizes performance).

‚úÖ Confidential Computing (encrypts data in use).


## 3. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (Managed Kubernetes)

"Managing containers at scale can be complex, but Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) simplifies this process by providing a fully managed Kubernetes environment. Since its launch in 2015, GKE has enabled organizations to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications seamlessly. Built on Google‚Äôs expertise with Kubernetes‚Äîthe open-source container orchestration platform that originated at Google‚ÄîGKE provides auto-scaling, security, and multi-cluster support. Whether running workloads on Google Cloud or in hybrid/multi-cloud environments with Anthos, GKE offers a powerful and flexible container management solution."


- GKE is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Google's infrastructure. 
- It offers automated operations, integrated security, and enterprise-grade support.
- Kubernetes Engine was launched and introduced by Google in year 2015. 

#### Primary use cases of Google Kubernetes Engine: Microservices, hybrid/multi-cloud applictions, and container orchestration.

### Key Features of Google Kubernetes Engine:
‚úÖ Auto-scaling (automatically adjusts compute resources).
‚úÖ GKE Autopilot (fully managed mode where Google handles cluster operations).
‚úÖ Multi-cluster & Multi-region support.
‚úÖ Built-in security features (IAM, encryption, and vulnerability scanning).
‚úÖ Hybrid and Multi-cloud Support (via Anthos).


## 4. Cloud Functions (FaaS - Even Drien Serverless)

"Cloud Functions revolutionizes application development by providing a serverless, event-driven computing model. Introduced in 2017, this Function as a Service (FaaS) offering lets developers execute lightweight functions in response to triggers from various Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and Firestore. Since it automatically scales and charges only for execution time, it eliminates the need for provisioning or managing servers, making it an ideal solution for real-time data processing, automation, and microservices-based architectures."

Introduction:

Launch Year: 2017
What it is: A Function as a Service (FaaS) that runs event-driven code without managing servers.
Primary Use Cases: Real-time data processing, IoT, API automation, and event-driven workloads.
Key Features:
‚úÖ Fully serverless (only pay for execution time).
‚úÖ Triggers from GCP services (Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Firestore, etc.).
‚úÖ Autoscaling from 0 to N requests.
‚úÖ Built-in security & monitoring.
‚úÖ Supports multiple runtimes (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP).


## 5. Cloud Run (Serverless Containers)

"Bridging the gap between serverless computing and containerization, Cloud Run provides a fully managed platform for running stateless, containerized applications. Launched in 2019, it enables businesses to deploy any application packaged as a container without worrying about infrastructure management. Cloud Run automatically scales based on demand and even scales down to zero when idle, ensuring cost efficiency. Its support for multiple programming languages, seamless integration with Google Cloud services, and built-in security features make it an attractive choice for modern application development."
